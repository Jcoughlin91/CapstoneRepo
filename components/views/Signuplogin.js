    If you have found yourself here, it’s likely because you are looking for
    love. There is an old saying, “The only thing that never changes is change
    itself”, well I can think of one thing that never changes in all human
    history. Simply, that is the feeling of love. To find love, to be in the
    feeling of love, is one of the greatest feelings a human being can ever
    experience. I would argue that love is timeless.
